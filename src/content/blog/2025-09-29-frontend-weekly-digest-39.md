Two weeks of frontend goodness packed into one digest. Framework updates, shiny new tools, and the State of JS survey is live. Let's go!

## 🔥 Framework Updates

### Vue / Nuxt

* **[TresJS v5](https://tresjs.org/blog/tresjs-v5)**
  Three.js + Vue just got smoother. New composables, better performance, and your 3D portfolio sites are about to level up.

* **[Nuxt UI v4](https://nuxt.com/blog/nuxt-ui-v4)**
  Nuxt's design system gets a major glow-up. New components, theming options, and tighter integration. The Vue ecosystem keeps delivering.

### React

* **[Hidden React Architecture Patterns](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/hidden-react-architecture-patterns-that-senior-developers-actually-use-f145fe680510)**
  The React patterns seniors use but never tweet about. Time to level up from tutorial-land to production reality.

## 🛠️ Developer Tools & Libraries

* **[Reshaped Goes OSS](https://reshaped.so/blog/reshaped-oss)** – Accessibility-first UI components, now open source. Your design system just got options.
* **[Chonkie TypeScript SDK](https://docs.chonkie.ai/typescript-sdk/getting-started/introduction)** – TypeScript meets AI with developer-friendly tooling. The SDK you didn't know you needed.
* **[Tailwind CSS Animations Plugin](https://tailwindcss-animations.vercel.app/)** – Midudev's prebuilt animations for Tailwind. Fade, slide, bounce — all the classics, zero config.
* **[Lens.js — Node.js Monitoring](https://medium.com/@urboifox/lens-js-open-source-monitoring-tool-for-the-node-js-world-2c954bbf4f59)** – Laravel Telescope vibes for Node. Track requests and queries with a slick UI.
* **[Slidev](https://sli.dev/)** – Markdown + Vue = presentation slides. Perfect for dev talks when PowerPoint feels wrong.
* **[Top 10 Docs Tools in 2025](https://dev.to/therealmrmumba/top-10-tools-to-create-beautiful-docs-in-2025-for-developers-teams-2c4j)** – The documentation tools worth your time. Pick one and actually write those docs.
* **[Layout Land](https://layout.bradwoods.io/)** – CSS layout playground. Stop guessing, start visualizing.
* **[The "Time" Layout Guide](https://ishadeed.com/article/time-layout/)** – Ahmad Shadeed's guide to time-based UI layouts. Clocks, timelines, countdowns — CSS handles it all.
* **[React Just Parallax](https://react-just-parallax.michalzalobny.com/)** – Lightweight parallax for React. Minimal setup, maximum wow factor.
* **[MCP UI](https://mcpui.dev/)** – Build Model Context Protocol interfaces. The AI tooling ecosystem is growing fast.
* **[Fliiipbook](https://www.fliiipbook.com/)** – Flipbook-style docs and learning resources. Interactive documentation done right.  

## 🌐 Web Trends & Insights

* **[State of JavaScript 2025 Survey Opens](https://survey.devographics.com/en-US/survey/state-of-js/2025)**
  The annual State of JS survey is live. Astro vs Next.js, Vite dethroning Webpack — drop your opinion and shape the discourse. You know you want to.

## 🎤 Conferences & Events

* **[ViteConf 2025](https://viteconf.amsterdam/)** – October 16–17, Amsterdam. The official Vite conference with core maintainers and ecosystem leaders. Mark your calendars.

* **[Vue Fes Japan 2025](https://vuefes.jp/2025/)** – November 9, Tokyo. Japan's biggest Vue conference returns. Global speakers, Nuxt updates, and probably amazing food.

## 🎮 Bonus Demos & Fun

* **[Doomscrolling: The Game](https://ironicsans.ghost.io/doomscrolling-the-game/)** – Infinite scrolling as literal gameplay. It's satire, but also oddly addictive.
* **[Poke-Holo](https://poke-holo.simey.me/)** – Holographic Pokémon card effects in the browser. Your inner collector is thrilled.
* **[You Don't Need Animations](https://emilkowal.ski/ui/you-dont-need-animations)** – A hot take on animation restraint. Sometimes less really is more. (Controversial, but worth considering.)
