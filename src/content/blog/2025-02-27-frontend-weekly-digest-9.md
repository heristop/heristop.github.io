## 🔥 Framework Updates

### React

- **(⚰️) [Create React App Is Dead](https://react.dev/blog/2025/02/14/sunsetting-create-react-app?ref=heristop.github.io)**

  The React team finally pulled the plug on CRA. Pour one out for `npx create-react-app my-app` — you served us well (kind of). Time to migrate to Vite or Next.js. The future is now, folks.

### Angular

- **(🅰️) [Angular 19.2 Update](https://blog.ninja-squad.com/2025/02/26/what-is-new-angular-19.2/?ref=heristop.github.io)**

  Experimental `httpResource` APIs and TypeScript 5.8 support dropped. Angular keeps shipping while the haters keep typing.

- **(🗺️) [Angular Roadmap](https://angular.dev/roadmap?ref=heristop.github.io)**

  Signals, zoneless Angular, and improved tooling are on the menu. The Angular team has been eating well lately.

### Vue.js

- **(💚) [Vue 3.6 Preview](https://www.cypress.io/blog/three-talks-to-check-out-at-vue-js-nation?ref=heristop.github.io)**

  Vapor Mode is coming and the Vue community can barely contain their excitement. Performance gains without the React drama? Sign us up.

- **(🔧) [Nuxt DevTools 2.0](https://github.com/nuxt/devtools/releases?ref=heristop.github.io)**

  Debugging just got a whole lot prettier. Editor integration that actually works.

### Svelte

- **(🧡) [Svelte 5.19 Release](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/releases?ref=heristop.github.io)**

  Minor updates improving reactivity and DX. Svelte keeps winning hearts one release at a time.

- **(🎮) [Threlte 8 (Three.js + Svelte)](https://threlte.xyz/blog/threlte-8?ref=heristop.github.io)**

  3D graphics in Svelte just got a major glow-up. Your portfolio sites are about to get *fancy*.

### Other Frameworks

  Async handling and reactivity improvements incoming. SolidJS continues to punch above its weight.

- **(▲) [Next.js 14 Updates](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-14-2?ref=heristop.github.io)**

  Caching and performance enhancements. Vercel's cash cow keeps getting shinier.

- **(🚀) [Astro 4.0](https://astro.build/blog/astro-4/?ref=heristop.github.io)**

  New APIs and performance boosts. The "ship less JavaScript" framework ships even less JavaScript.

## 🛠️ Developer Tools & Libraries

- **(📚) [Storybook 8.5](https://storybook.js.org/blog/storybook-8-5/?ref=heristop.github.io)**

  Real-time a11y testing and better React Native Web integration. Your design system thanks you.

- **(🔗) [tRPC + TanStack Query Integration](https://trpc.io/blog/introducing-tanstack-react-query-client?ref=heristop.github.io)**

  TypeScript end-to-end just got even more type-safe. Runtime errors? Never heard of them.

## 🌐 Web Standards & Browser Updates

- **(🌍) [Interop 2025](https://webkit.org/blog/16458/announcing-interop-2025/?ref=heristop.github.io)**

  Browser compatibility improvements across 19 focus areas. The "works in Chrome but not Safari" era is (slowly) ending.

- **(🎨) [Chrome 134 & WebGPU](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/new-in-webgpu-134?ref=heristop.github.io)**

  New GPU capabilities for better performance. Your fancy WebGL demos just got fancier.

- **(📜) [TC39 Stage 4 Proposals](https://socket.dev/blog/tc39-advances-3-proposals-to-stage-4-regexp-escaping-float16array-and-redeclarable-global-eval?ref=heristop.github.io)**

  RegExp escaping, Float16Array, and more reaching standardization. JavaScript keeps evolving.

## 📈 Trends & Best Practices

- **(📊) [State of CSS 2024](https://web.dev/blog/state-of-css-html-2024?ref=heristop.github.io)**

  `:has()`, Container Queries, and CSS Nesting are trending. CSS is eating JavaScript's lunch.

- **(🪶) [Less JavaScript Movement](https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/01/27/the-less-javascript-the-better-ep-532/?ref=heristop.github.io)**
