**Next.js** leads with steady growth, reaching around 60% adoption in 2023. Its strengths lie in server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG), making it a popular choice for developers. **Nuxt** follows closely for Vue.js users, maintaining stable adoption rates. **Gatsby** has seen a decline after peaking in 2020, losing ground to more modern solutions. **SvelteKit** and **Remix** are gaining traction, with developers appreciating their performance and modern features. **Astro** is growing rapidly, favored for its ultra-fast static site generation. **Eleventy**, **Docusaurus**, **SolidStart**, and **Deno Fresh** show modest adoption but potential for growth, reflecting interest in specialized use cases and new paradigms. 🛠️

## Testing Tools Ratios Over Time

**Jest** has grown significantly since 2016, showing high awareness, interest, and usage among developers. It reached its peak usage in 2023, despite a slight dip in positivity. **Mocha**, once a leading tool, has seen a decline in usage and positivity since 2016. **Storybook** has maintained steady growth, particularly noted for its component-driven development. **Cypress** and **Playwright** have seen consistent growth in awareness and usage, with **Playwright** noted for its reliability. Tools like **WebdriverIO** and **Selenium** have shown declining trends, while newer tools like **Vitest** are quickly gaining traction due to their performance. 🧪

## Build Tools Ratios Over Time

**Webpack**, once dominant, is seeing a decline in positivity and retention despite high usage. **Parcel** and **Rollup**, initially promising, show declining interest and positivity. **SWC** and **esbuild**, known for their speed, are gaining traction. **Vite** stands out with high awareness, interest, and retention, reflecting a strong preference for faster build tools. New entries like **Turbopack** and **tsup** indicate a continuous search for more efficient solutions in the build tool ecosystem. 🛠️

## Monorepo Tools Ratios Over Time

**Turborepo** and **pnpm** lead the pack with growing awareness and usage, reflecting their efficiency and developer satisfaction. **Nx** shows moderate growth in awareness and interest, while **Yarn Workspaces** and **npm Workspaces** maintain steady adoption. Tools like **Rush**, **Yalc**, and **Lerna** have lower awareness and usage, indicating room for improvement or potential decline. 📦
