**🎯 TL;DR:** Angular 20 revolutionizes with Signals + Zoneless = -10.4% transfer size, no Zone.js polyfills, enhanced performance

## 🧠 Signals: The New Reactivity

**What it is:** A modern reactivity system that advantageously replaces RxJS for local state management.

```typescript
// Before (complex)
this.userService.getUser().pipe(map(user => user.name)).subscribe(...)

// After (simple)
count = signal(0)
doubleCount = computed(() => this.count() * 2)
```

**Ultra-simple template:**

```html
<div>{{ count() }}</div> <!-- No more | async needed -->
```

## ⚡ Zoneless: Maximum Performance

Zone.js completely removed = No polyfills + granular change detection

```typescript
// Angular 19: polyfills needed (34.52 kB)
// Angular 20: ✅ No polyfills needed!

// Simple configuration
export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
  providers: [
    provideZonelessChangeDetection(), // 🎯 Magic!
    // ...
  ],
}
```

## 📊 Real Measured Results (Custom Starter Kit)

### Bundle Size Comparison

| Version | Raw Size | Transfer Size | Features |
|---------|----------|---------------|----------|
| **Angular 19** | 744.97 kB | 144.87 kB | Standard setup |
| **Angular 20** | 725.47 kB | 129.78 kB | Signals + Zoneless + Enhanced features |

### Performance Gains

| Metric | Improvement | Impact |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Raw Bundle** | -19.5 kB (-2.6%) | Faster initial load |
| **Transfer Size** | -15.09 kB (-10.4%) | **Better network performance** |
| **Build Time** | 2.720s | Optimized compilation |
| **Zone.js** | ✅ Removed | No polyfills needed |

> 📈 **Key insight:** These metrics are from a custom starter kit comparing Angular 19 vs 20. Even with more features in Angular 20, better performance is achieved thanks to Zoneless architecture!

## 🎨 Winning Pattern

```typescript
export class ModernComponent {
  // Simple state
  data = signal<User[]>([])
  
  // Automatic derived state
  activeUsers = computed(() => this.data().filter(u => u.active))
  
  // Reactive updates
  updateData(newData: User[]) {
    this.data.set(newData) // All computed automatically update!
  }
}
```

## 🏆 Why Adopt Now?

✅ **Performance**: Granular change detection + faster builds (2.720s)  
✅ **Simplicity**: No more RxJS complexity for local state  
✅ **Bundle**: No Zone.js polyfills (34.52 kB saved)  
✅ **Network**: -10.4% transfer size for better loading  

## 🚦 Express Migration

1. **New project**: `provideZonelessChangeDetection()`
2. **Existing project**: Progressive migration by component
3. **Pattern replacement**: `BehaviorSubject` → `signal()`
