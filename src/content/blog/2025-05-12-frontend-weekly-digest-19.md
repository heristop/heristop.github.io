## 🔥 Framework Updates

### Angular

* **[Angular 20 RC](https://medium.com/@sehban.alam/whats-coming-in-angular-20-7762cfd21d9f?ref=zazen_code)**: Finally dropping Zone.js for zoneless change detection and an experimental signal-based Forms API. Angular just keeps getting faster while the haters keep typing.

* **[Standalone Component Gotcha](https://dev.to/this-is-angular/the-angular-standalone-component-gotcha-i-didnt-see-coming-3571?ref=zazen_code)**: Forgot to import `CommonModule` and wondering why `*ngFor` isn't working? You're not alone. A cautionary tale we've all lived.

### Svelte

* **[Await in Svelte Components](https://svelte.dev/blog/whats-new-in-svelte-may-2025?ref=zazen_code)**: Direct `await` syntax in components? Svelte making async look easy, as usual. No more callback gymnastics.

### Astro

* **[Astro 5.7 Released](https://astro.build/blog/astro-570/?ref=zazen_code)**: Stable sessions, SVG components, and an experimental Fonts API. Astro keeps shipping while staying true to the "less JavaScript" philosophy.

### Nuxt

* **[Nuxt 3.17](https://nuxt.com/blog/v3-17?ref=zazen_code)**: Async data fetching upgrades, a shiny new `<NuxtTime>` component, and runtime performance boosts. The Vue meta-framework that keeps on giving.

## 🛠️ Developer Tools & Libraries

* **[Node.js 24](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v24.0.0/?ref=zazen_code)**: New V8 engine, global `URLPattern` API, and MSVC support is finally out. Goodbye, Windows legacy builds.

* **[GSAP 3.13](https://gsap.com/blog/3-13/?ref=zazen_code)**: GSAP is now completely free, including all premium plugins. Thanks Webflow! Your wallet can breathe again.

* **[Electron 36.0](https://www.electronjs.org/blog/electron-36-0?ref=zazen_code)**: Chromium 136, Node 22.14, and macOS Writing Tools integration. Your Electron apps just got a glow-up.

## 🌐 Web Standards & Browser Updates

* **[Chrome 135](https://web.dev/blog/web-platform-04-2025?ref=zazen_code)**: Native carousel controls with `::scroll-button()` and `::scroll-marker()` plus a new CSS `shape()` function. Chrome shipping features faster than you can learn them.

* **[Firefox 137 & 138](https://web.dev/blog/web-platform-04-2025?ref=zazen_code)**: `Atomics.pause()`, better hyphenation, and import maps integrity checks. Firefox doing the unglamorous work that matters.

* **[CSS `shape()` Function](https://webkit.org/blog/16794/the-css-shape-function/?ref=zazen_code)**: Define complex, responsive shapes in pure CSS. WebKit is making designers question why they ever needed SVG.

* **[ECMAScript 2025 Final Draft](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3952000/fast-and-simple-javascript-frameworks.html?ref=zazen_code)**: JSON modules, enhanced Set methods, and regex improvements are now official. JavaScript evolution never stops.

## 📈 Trends & Best Practices

* **[JSX Over The Wire](https://overreacted.io/jsx-over-the-wire/?ref=zazen_code)**: Dan Abramov back at it, questioning everything we thought we knew about client-side rendering. Server-rendered React components sent over the wire? The future is weird.

* **[Self-Hosting for Developers](https://dev.to/code42cate/every-developer-needs-to-self-host-43mm?ref=zazen_code)**: Want to truly understand how software works? Host it yourself. Learn networking, sysadmin, and why DevOps folks deserve more coffee.

* **[AI-Augmented Development](https://medium.com/@ignatovich.dm/frontend-development-trends-in-2025-bef95f50aa2e?ref=zazen_code)**: GitHub Copilot and Figma AI integrations are automating the boring stuff. Your job is safe (probably), but your excuses for slow PRs aren't.

* **[Zeroth-Virtual DOM (Vue Vapor Mode)](https://vueschool.io/articles/news/vn-talk-evan-you-preview-of-vue-3-6-vapor-mode/?ref=zazen_code)**: Skip the virtual DOM entirely and match Solid.js performance. Evan You really said "hold my beer."

* **[Less JavaScript, More Server](https://www.netguru.com/blog/front-end-trends?ref=zazen_code)**: SSR and island architecture are trending. Turns out shipping less JS makes websites faster. Who knew?

* **[Accessible by Design (WCAG 3.0)](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2025/05/wcag-3-proposed-scoring-model-shift-accessibility-evaluation/?ref=zazen_code)**: New scoring-based accessibility standards. A11y isn't optional anymore — it's a feature.
