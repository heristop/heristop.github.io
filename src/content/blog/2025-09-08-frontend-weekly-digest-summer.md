Summer 2025 was hot — and not just the weather. Major framework updates, new tools, and hot takes on frontend architecture. Here's what you might have missed while touching grass.

## 🔥 Framework Updates

### Angular

* **[Angular Summer Update 2025](https://blog.angular.dev/angular-summer-update-2025-1987592a0b42)**
  Angular v20.1 and v20.2 went zoneless in production, added CSS animation APIs, and shipped an experimental MCP server for AI tooling. Angular haters in shambles — it just keeps getting better.

### React

* **[React's `use()` API Is About to Make `useContext` Obsolete](https://blog.logrocket.com/reacts-use-api-makes-usecontext-obsolete)**
  The `use()` API simplifies async data and state handling. Another React hook to learn, but this one might actually reduce boilerplate. Revolutionary concept.

### Vue / Nuxt

* **[Post-Flush Watchers vs `nextTick`](https://michaelnthiessen.com/the-difference-between-a-post-flush-watcher-and-nexttick)**
  Michael Thiessen explains Vue's async update cycle. If you've ever wondered why `nextTick()` didn't work when you expected it to — this is the article you needed.

## 🛠️ Developer Tools & Libraries

* **[Front-End Checklist](https://github.com/thedaviddias/Front-End-Checklist)** – Best practices you probably forgot. Bookmark it, check it before every deploy.
* **[JavaScript Algorithms](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms)** – Classic algorithms in JS. For when LeetCode anxiety hits.
* **[Awesome Node.js Security](https://github.com/lirantal/awesome-nodejs-security)** – Security resources because npm audit alone won't save you.
* **[Layout Generator](https://layout.bradwoods.io/)** – CSS Grid and Flexbox, visualized. Stop guessing grid-template-areas.
* **[SVG.Land](https://svgl.app/)** – Craft SVG patterns in the browser. Your designers will thank you.
* **[Animate Icons](https://animateicons.vercel.app/)** – 160+ animated SVG icons. Micro-interactions, here we come.
* **[JSV9000](https://www.jsv9000.app/)** – Visualize JS execution. Finally understand the event loop (maybe).
* **[CSS Circular Gallery](https://css-tip.com/circular-gallery/)** – 61 images in a circle, pure CSS. Because you can.
* **[Theatre.js](https://www.theatrejs.com/)** – Cinematic animation library for when GSAP isn't dramatic enough.  

## 🌐 Web Trends & Insights

* **[The Future of JavaScript](https://jsdev.space/future-of-javascript)**
  TC39's pipeline is wild: `using` keyword, `Array.fromAsync`, `Error.isError`, and more. JavaScript evolution never sleeps.

* **[What's New: August 2025](https://voidzero.dev/posts/whats-new-aug-2025)**
  VoidZero's Vite ecosystem update: RSC support, Vitest v4 beta, Rolldown gains, and Oxlint going type-aware. Evan You's team is on fire.

* **[You Might Not Need Next.js](https://dev.to/paripsky/you-might-not-need-nextjs-4ejg)**
  Controversial take: sometimes a simple SPA is enough. Cue the "it depends" discourse.

* **[HTMX – Server Components Without React](https://swizec.com/blog/htmx-server-components-without-react)**
  Server-driven UI without the React overhead. HTMX keeps proving there's more than one way to build the web.

* **[Optimizing Nuxt Apps for Core Web Vitals](https://dev.to/jacobandrewsky/optimizing-nuxt-apps-for-core-web-vitals-106j)**
  Delayed hydration, image optimization, CLS fixes — the Nuxt performance cookbook you needed.

* **[Better Auth: The Game-Changer](https://blog.curbanii.net/better-auth-the-game-changer-js-authentication-has-been-waiting-for/)**
  A new auth library that's framework-agnostic, supports passkeys, 2FA, roles, and more. Auth hell might finally have an exit.

## 🎮 Bonus Demos & Talks

* **[Frontend Architecture: A New Era (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoNmm4YS8e4)** – A great talk on emerging architecture patterns. Worth the watch if you're rethinking your app structure.
