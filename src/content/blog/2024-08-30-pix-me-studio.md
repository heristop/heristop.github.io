**Pix Me!** is an app I developed to explore AI capabilities in image transformation. It converts selfies into different pop culture styles.

## What is Pix Me!?

Pix Me! is an AI-powered image transformer. It takes your selfie and converts it into various pop culture styles. You can try it for free, or use your own API key for additional options.

## 🔮 Transform yourself into

- A Pixar character ready for adventure
- An adorable big-eyed chibi
- A LEGO minifigure ready to be assembled
- A South Park resident (watch out for blasphemy!)
- A blocky Minecraft adventurer
- A zombie straight out of a horror movie
- And many more wild styles!

Each style produces different results.

## ✨ How It Works: Prompt Engineering

Pix Me! combines AI models with prompt engineering:

- **GPT-4o**: This powerful language model helps understand and process your requests.
- **DALL-E-3 or Flux.1 [PRO]**: These image generation models bring your transformed selfies to life.

Precise prompts guide these AI models to create the specific styles and transformations.

## Built with Love (and Code)

The interface is built with Nuxt 3 and Tailwind CSS, providing a responsive user experience across devices.
