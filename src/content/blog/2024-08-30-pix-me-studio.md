Have you ever wondered what you'd look like as a Pixar character or a LEGO minifigure? Well, wonder no more! I'm excited to introduce you to **Pix Me!**, a small app I developed to explore the creative potential of AI in image transformation.

## What is Pix Me!?

Pix Me! is your personal AI-powered image transformer. It takes your selfie and reimagines it in various pop culture styles. The best part? You can try it for free! And for those who want to dive deeper, you can even use your own API key for even more options.

## üîÆ Transform yourself into

- A Pixar character ready for adventure
- An adorable big-eyed chibi
- A LEGO minifigure ready to be assembled
- A South Park resident (watch out for blasphemy!)
- A blocky Minecraft adventurer
- A zombie straight out of a horror movie
- And many more wild styles!

The possibilities are endless, and the results are always surprising (and often hilarious)!

## ‚ú® The Magic Behind the Scenes: Prompt Engineering

You might be wondering how Pix Me! works its magic. The secret sauce is a combination of advanced AI models and careful prompt engineering. Here's what's under the hood:

- **GPT-4o**: This powerful language model helps understand and process your requests.
- **DALL-E-3 or Flux.1 [PRO]**: These image generation models bring your transformed selfies to life.

By crafting precise prompts for these AI models, it's possible to guide them to create the specific styles and transformations you see in Pix Me!.

## Built with Love (and Code)

As a developer, I couldn't resist adding some personal touches. The interface is built with Nuxt 3 and Tailwind CSS, because even devs like pretty things üòâ. This combination allows for a smooth, responsive user experience that looks great on any device.
