A packed couple of weeks covering mid-May through early June 2025. Major framework drops, tool upgrades, and some drama in the meta-framework world. Let's dive in!

## 🔥 Framework Updates

### Angular

* **[Angular 20 Released](https://www.bacancytechnology.com/blog/angular-20?ref=heristop.github.io)**: Angular v20 dropped May 29, 2025.

### Remix

* **[Remix Reimagined](https://remix.run/blog/wake-up-remix?ref=heristop.github.io)**: Remix "woke up" from its nap (post React Router 7 merge) and chose violence.
