The rapid evolution of technologies in the development world poses a significant challenge in the recruitment process: should we seek an expert in a specific technology or value versatility and learning ability? From my experience as a full-stack developer and Chapter Lead, a conclusion emerges: curiosity and flexibility seem more valuable than narrow expertise in a given technology. The question then arises: where do we find the balance between these two approaches? ü§î

At first glance, recruiting a senior developer who has mastered a specific language or framework might seem reassuring. However, this approach overlooks a crucial reality: the technological landscape is constantly evolving, and this is even more pronounced if I focus particularly on frontend technologies. Thus, a developer who excels in a technology today might find themselves outdated tomorrow if they do not continuously update their skills or if their main competence becomes obsolete.

It is quite common for a developer joining a new company or a client's mission to not be entirely familiar with the existing technology stack. Consequently, their ability to quickly assimilate new knowledge, adapt, and integrate new skills becomes a crucial aspect.

Curiosity can thus be seen as an essential skill: a curious developer does not merely follow trends; they explore, understand, and integrate them into their work. This open and proactive approach is essential to remain relevant in a constantly changing field and to add value to projects.

üë®‚ÄçüöÄ Furthermore, I have sometimes observed this ability in some juniors who turned out to be more effective than more traditional seniors, thanks to a limitless explorer's mentality that pushed them to go beyond established conventions.

The real challenge for companies is therefore to find a developer with a solid technical background, curiosity, and an eagerness to learn to adapt to changes. If they lack a skill today, they will not only be able to acquire it quickly but also bring new perspectives and explore potentially more innovative paths. This mindset should be a pillar in the recruitment process.
