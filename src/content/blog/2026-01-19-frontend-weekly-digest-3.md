## 📢 News & Trends

- **(🎂) [jQuery 4.0.0 Released — Happy 20th Birthday!](https://blog.jquery.com/2026/01/17/jquery-4-0-0/?ref=zazen_code)**

  The library that taught us all `$(document).ready()` is back with its first major release in nearly a decade! IE10 support is finally gone (RIP), ES modules are in, and Trusted Types support makes your CSP policies happy. Still powering 90% of the web — not bad for a "dead" library!

- **(🦀) [TypeScript 7 Goes Full Speed with Go](https://www.infoq.com/news/2026/01/typescript-7-progress/?ref=zazen_code)**

  Microsoft said "hold my beer" and rewrote TypeScript in Go. The result? VS Code's 1.5M lines now compile in 7.5s instead of 78s. That's 10x faster, folks. Your `tsc --watch` might actually finish before your coffee gets cold now.

- **(⚡) [Vite 8 Beta: Rolldown Goes Brrrrr](https://vite.dev/blog/announcing-vite8-beta?ref=zazen_code)**

  Evan You wasn't kidding — Rolldown is here and it's *fast*. Linear's builds went from 46s to 6s. Some devs report 5x improvements. At this rate, our builds will finish before we hit save.

  Cloudflare Workers setup is now a one-liner, and the new Svelte MCP is pretty slick. The language-tools got a performance glow-up too. Svelte keeps winning hearts.
